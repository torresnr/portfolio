    <h1>ABOUT ME: Naida Torres</h1>

    <section id="AboutMe">
        <h3>Hello!</h3>

        <p>My name is Naida Torres and am currently a senior at Clarkson University, double majoring in computer science and data science.
            I am currently looking for internship and full-time opportunities to further my education specifically with machine learning and data analysis.
            I have research experience doing in-depth development and analysis of data sets involving genotypes and probability.
            This work has had real life implications, being used in court cases, shedding a light on the systemic challenges faced by society and judicary at large.
            Additionally, I have in class, collaborative process experience, creating a MySQL database and ETL warehouse and led the successful development of a robust ‘Slack-’based messaging system using Java.</p>

        <p>Education and career aside, I was born and raised in the Bronx.
            Growing up in such a diverse area allowed me to meet so many different people and appreciate culture at its core.
            I enjoy gaming, baking, scrapbooking, and spending time with my friends.
            Gaming introduced me to this career path, and I am thankful for the opportunities I have been given.
            I strive to make an impact for not only women in STEM, but specifically hispanic women in data science, as we are few and far between.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me! Feel free to contact me by email at naidatorres5133@gmail.com.</p>
